This is a fancy titled
Don't you think?
Regular Text
Header 5
[** Header 4]
[*** Header 3]
[**** Header 2]
[***** Header 1]
[****** Header 0]
I think this [* bold] text is better than the [/ italic] one, but certainly its better than the [_ underlined] or [- striked-through] one.
[/ This is italic text with some [* bold] text in-between, maybe [* twice] .]
[* This is bold text with some [/ italic] text in-between, maybe [/ twice] .]
[_ This is underline text with some [* bold,] some [/ italic] and some [- strike-through] text.]
[*/-_ Super fancy text 1 order: underline, italic, strike-through, bold]
[*/-_ Super fancy text 2 order: bold, strike through, italic, underline]
This is some [_ marked text] to remember!
A block of code
code:_
	function myfunction (a, b) {
	  let x = a * 1.08
	  let y = b * 2
	  return x * y
	}

could be as cool as a checkbox:
	⬜ Item 1
	⬜ Item 2
	✅ Item 3 (selected)
	⬜ Item 4

an ordered list
	1. France
	2. Italy
	3. Norway

or an unordered list
	cheese
		1. Camembert
		2. Gauda
		3. Blue Cheese
			Roquefort
			Gorgonzola
			Blue Stilton
		4. Emmental
	wine
	barbeque

Two images, attached:

	whos	[/ house]	[_ runs]
	[* house]	I	[http://test.com said]
			
		whos	house?

Some horizontal spacer

Lets align it right

Indent a little
> A little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little bit of everything lets me

>> Indent a little further

super script works ass well as subscript and
how about a little font change or [** size change?] colors can be changed too
