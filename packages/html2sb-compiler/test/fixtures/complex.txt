Don't you think?


Regular Text

Header 5

[** Header 4]

[*** Header 3]

[**** Header 2]

[***** Header 1]

[****** Header 0]


I think this [* bold] text is better than the [/ italic] one, but certainly its better than the [_ underlined] or [- striked-through] one.


[/ This is italic text with some [* bold] text in-between, maybe [* twice] .]


[* This is bold text with some [/ italic] text in-between, maybe [/ twice] .]


[_ This is underline text with some [* bold,] some [/ italic] and some [- strike-through] text.]


[*/-_ Super fancy text 1 order: underline, italic, strike-through, bold]


[*/-_ Super fancy text 2 order: bold, strike through, italic, underline]


This is some [_ marked text] to remember!


A block of code


code:_
	function myfunction (a, b) {
	  let x = a * 1.08
	  let y = b * 2
	  return x * y
	}


could be as cool as a checkbox:


	⬜ Item 1
	⬜ Item 2
	✅ Item 3 (selected)
	⬜ Item 4


an ordered list


	1. France
	2. Italy
	3. Norway


or an unordered list

	cheese
		1. Camembert
		2. Gauda
		3. Blue Cheese
			Roquefort
			Gorgonzola
			Blue Stilton
		4. Emmental
	wine
	barbeque


Links should work as well, to [http://google.com google] for example.
